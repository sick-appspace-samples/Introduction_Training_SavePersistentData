## Introduction_Training_SavePersistentData
Store data persistently on the device

### How to Run
Drag and drop this ZIP archive to the working directory of SICK AppStudio.
Starting this SampleApp is possible either by running the SensorApp (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10) it. Setting a breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after the event 'Engine.OnStarted' has
been emitted. Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage if
available.
To run this SampleApp a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= v2.5.0
is required, e.g. a SIM4000 with latest firmware installed. Alternatively, the
embedded emulator within SICK AppStudio v3.6.0 or higher can be used.

### Information
This SampleApp is part of the e-learning training courses for the SICK AppSpace
introduction. Thus, the contained source code will be explained step-by-step and
in more details within this course.
The purpose of this one is to give an example for storing different kinds of
data persistently on the device.
